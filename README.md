Based on the provided data, we see that Charter schools have higher average scores in math and reading. Charter schools lead the chart for Highest-Performing Schools. We can also see that District schools are the bottom performing schools. We can obeserve a corelation between the spending ranges per student and the overall passing rate. It shows that the less amount of money spent on each student generates higher score averages. We can also observe that schools that have a small to medium student population (<=2000) have higher math and reading averages and an overall percent passing rate. In summary, Charter schools have better scores than District schools.
